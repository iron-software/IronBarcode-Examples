Iron Barcode offers a handy functionality that enables the exporting of barcodes into self-contained HTML formats. This means everything is embedded directly within the HTML file, eliminating the need for any external image assets.

You can choose to export in several formats including an **HTML file**, **HTML image tag**, or a **data URI**.
