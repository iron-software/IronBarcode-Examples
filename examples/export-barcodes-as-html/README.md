Iron Barcode offers an extremely beneficial capability where barcodes can be generated and saved into a self-contained HTML file. This means that all necessary components, including images, are embedded directly within the HTML itself, eliminating any dependencies on external image assets.

You have options to export the barcode in various formats, including a complete **HTML file**, an **HTML image tag**, or a **data URI**. This flexibility allows developers to choose the best method that suits their project's needs.
