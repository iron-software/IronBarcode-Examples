Iron Barcode offers a powerful feature enabling the export of barcodes as standalone HTML files. These files are self-contained, requiring no external image assets. All necessary data is embedded directly within the HTML file itself.

You can choose to export the barcodes in three different formats: as an **HTML file**, an **HTML image tag**, or to a **data URI**.
