The `BarcodeWriter.CreateBarcode` method facilitates the generation of barcodes and QR codes from text, numeric, or binary data and encodes them into the desired format. To export the generated barcode, you can use the `SaveAsImage()` function, or other convenient saving options such as saving to a PDF, HTML, `System.Drawing.Image`, stream, or `Bitmap` object.

On the other hand, barcode reading is handled by the `BarcodeReader` class. The simplest approach to reading barcodes is employing the `BarcodeReader.Read` method as demonstrated previously.

It is important to note the variety of settings available in `BarcodeReaderOptions`. These settings enable you to customize the reading process. You can enhance the reading speed, intensify scan processes, cease scanning after a single barcode to conserve time, filter for specific barcode types, and employ multithreading, among other customization possibilities.
