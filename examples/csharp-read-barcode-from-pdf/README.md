You can easily decode barcodes using the `BarcodeReader` class. A highly straightforward approach is to employ the `BarcodeReader.Read` method as demonstrated. 

Please be aware of the numerous configurations available in `BarcodeReaderOptions`. These settings offer customization that can enhance the speed of reading, intensify the scan, halt after detecting the first barcode to conserve time, target specific barcode types for detection, and enable the use of multithreading, among various other customization possibilities.
