The `BarcodeReader` class provides a straightforward way to decode barcodes. The simplest approach is to utilize the `BarcodeReader.Read` method, as demonstrated. 

Consider the various settings available in `BarcodeReaderOptions` which enhance the flexibility of the process. These settings enable you to accelerate the reading process, increase the scanning detail, halt the process after a single barcode is detected—thereby saving time—select specific barcode formats for scanning, and employ multithreading, among other customizable options.
