In this illustration, we explore how various types of barcodes, encompassing multiple formats, can be crafted, adjusted in size, and stored using minimal code, sometimes even a single line.

Leveraging the Fluent API, the barcode class provided can enable modifications such as setting margins, resizing, and annotating barcodes. These can subsequently be saved in various image formats. IronOCR intuitively identifies and applies the correct image format based on the file extension, including **GIFs, HTML files, HTML tags, JPEGs, PDFs, PNGs, TIFFs, and Windows Bitmaps**.

Additionally, the method `StampToExistingPdfPage` is particularly handy. It facilitates the creation and application of a barcode onto an existing PDF document. This functionality is particularly useful for modifying standard PDFs or embedding a unique internal identification code into a document through a barcode.
