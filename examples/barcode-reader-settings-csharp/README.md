IronBarcode provides the `BarcodeReaderOptions` class, which comes equipped with several adjustable settings to enhance and customize the barcode reading process. You have the flexibility to allocate more system resources to improve reading accuracy, choose between detecting a single barcode or multiple barcodes, specify the types of barcodes to detect, define a specific crop area for focused reading, and control the number of concurrent threads for parallel processing.
