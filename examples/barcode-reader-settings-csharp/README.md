`IronBarcode` offers a suite of customization options through its `BarcodeReaderOptions` class, enabling enhanced and refined barcode reading capabilities. Adjustments can be made to allocate more resources for improved accuracy, determine whether to cease operation after a single barcode is detected or to continue scanning for multiple, specify which barcode types to recognize, concentrate on a specific cropped area, and control the maximum number of concurrent threads.
