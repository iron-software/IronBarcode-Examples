IronBarcode provides flexible configurations through the `BarcodeReaderOptions` class, enabling tailored and efficient barcode reading. Options include allocating more resources for enhanced accuracy, choosing to halt after a single barcode detection or continuing to scan for multiple, specifying the types of barcodes to identify, targeting a specific cropping area, and setting the maximum number of concurrent threads.
