In this example, we explore how barcodes can be customized with any desired text, either chosen by the user or derived directly from the barcode value. This customization can utilize any font present on the system; if the specified font isn't available, a closely matching alternative will be used. Additionally, barcodes can be resized, margins may be adjusted, and the colors of both the barcode and its background can be altered. After customizations, the barcodes can be exported in a suitable file format.

Towards the end of the code snippet, it's illustrated how our fluent style operators enable the creation and styling of a barcode in a minimal amount of code, reminiscent of the `System.Linq` approach.
