In this example, it's demonstrated that barcodes can be customized with text, either user-defined or the barcode's own value, utilizing any font installed on the system. Should the selected font be unavailable, a similar substitute will be used. Adjustments such as resizing and margination are possible, along with recoloring the barcode and its background. The final result can be saved in various formats.

The code snippets towards the end illustrate how, by leveraging fluent style syntax akin to `System.Linq`, one can efficiently generate and style a barcode in just a few lines.
