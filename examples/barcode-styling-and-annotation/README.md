In the provided example, we observe that barcodes can be enhanced with customizable text, either using the barcode's value or any text you prefer, utilizing any typeface existing on the destination machine. Should the selected typeface be unavailable, a suitable alternative will be automatically chosen. Additionally, the barcodes can be adjusted in size, augmented with margins, and both the barcode itself and its background can be recolored. The finished barcode can then be saved in a variety of formats.

Towards the end of the sample code, it's evident that by employing our streamlined and fluent style operators, one can easily generate and customize a barcode using just a few lines of code, akin to the `System.Linq`.
