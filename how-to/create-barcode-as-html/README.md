# How to Convert Barcodes to HTML with IronBarcode

---

IronBarcode gives developers robust flexibility for utilizing `GeneratedBarcode` in various outputs, which importantly includes HTML. This feature allows the barcode to be integrated directly into web applications or temporarily stored in memory instead of on disk.

This guide will explore different methodologies for converting `GeneratedBarcode` to HTML formats, including as a Data URL, an HTML Tag, and an HTML File.

## Converting Barcode to a Data URL

A Data URL or data URI lets you embed data directly within a URL, which can be included in a webpage as if it were an external resource. This transformation is useful for embedding images, videos, audio, and more directly into your HTML using the `src` attribute of an image tag. Below is how to apply this to a `GeneratedBarcode`.

```cs
using IronBarCode;
using System;

// Create a new QR Code Barcode
GeneratedBarcode myBarcode = BarcodeWriter.CreateBarcode("https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/barcode/", BarcodeEncoding.QRCode);

// Convert the barcode to a Data URL
var dataUrl = myBarcode.ToDataUrl();

// Output the Data URL to console
Console.WriteLine(dataUrl);
```

In the above example, we initiate a barcode generation using `BarcodeWriter.CreateBarcode`, specify the content and type, and then convert the barcode to a Data URL using `ToDataUrl()`. This URL can be further utilized within an application or merely displayed using `Console.WriteLine()`.

## Converting Barcode to an HTML Tag

Alternatively, `GeneratedBarcode` can be exported directly as an HTML tag. This is accomplished with the `ToHtmlTag()` method which does not require any JavaScript, CSS, or external resources.

```cs
using IronBarCode;
using System;

// Create a new QR Code Barcode
GeneratedBarcode myBarcode = BarcodeWriter.CreateBarcode("https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/barcode/", BarcodeEncoding.QRCode);

// Convert the barcode to an HTML tag
var htmlTag = myBarcode.ToHtmlTag();

// Display the HTML tag
Console.WriteLine(htmlTag);
```

The code shown above attaches `ToHtmlTag()` to the `GeneratedBarcode`, instantly producing an HTML image tag injected with the Data URL of the barcode, complete with image dimensions. This tag is ready for embedding into a larger HTML document.

## Saving Barcode as an HTML File

IronBarcode also supports saving the `GeneratedBarcode` directly as an HTML file using the `SaveAsHtmlFile()` method.

```cs
using IronBarCode;

// Create a new QR Code Barcode
GeneratedBarcode myBarcode = BarcodeWriter.CreateBarcode("https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/barcode/", BarcodeEncoding.QRCode);

// Save the barcode as an HTML file
myBarcode.SaveAsHtmlFile("myBarcode.html");
```

This approach exports the barcode as a standalone HTML file, saving it to disk at the specified location. The resulting file includes a complete HTML document structure with the barcode embedded within.

In summary, IronBarcode empowers developers to deploy `GeneratedBarcode` in flexible HTML formats, catering to various use cases, especially in web environments. Each method offers unique solutions for integrating barcode technology seamlessly into web applications.
