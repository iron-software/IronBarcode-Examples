# IronBarCode's Compatibility with macOS for .NET Applications

***Based on <https://ironsoftware.com/how-to/macos/>***


IronBarCode now offers complete support for macOS (previously referred to as "OS X") across .NET Standard Libraries, Core applications, and .NET 5 projects.

The library is fully compatible with all versions of macOS right out of the box.

Developers targeting Apple's platform do not need to modify any existing code.

Our commitment to macOS support stems from the fact that many .NET developers, including some of our own team members, prefer using _Visual Studio for Mac_ and _JetBrains Rider_ to develop .NET applications on macOS.

## Setup and Installation on macOS

IronBarCode's NuGet packages are readily available for macOS deployments, as detailed in our [IronBarCode NuGet installation guide](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/barcode/docs/).
