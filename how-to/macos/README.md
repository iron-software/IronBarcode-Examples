# IronBarCode Compatibility with macOS using .NET Core

IronBarCode now offers complete support for macOS (previously known as "OS X") in the context of .NET Standard Libraries, Core applications, and .NET 5 initiatives.

This compatibility covers all existing versions of macOS right out of the box.

Implementing IronBarCode on macOS does not require any modifications to your existing code.

Our commitment to macOS support stems from the preference among many .NET developers, including several from our team, to code .NET applications using _Visual Studio for Mac_ or _JetBrains Rider_ on macOS.

## Setting Up and Installing on macOS

For deployment on Mac, IronBarCode NuGet packages are outlined in our [IronBarCode NuGet installation guide](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/barcode/docs/).
