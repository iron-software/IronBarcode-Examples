# IronBarcode Enhanced Compatibility with macOS for .NET Core

***Based on <https://ironsoftware.com/how-to/macos/>***


IronBarCode now offers complete support for macOS (previously known as "OS X") across .NET Standard Libraries, Core applications, and .NET 5 projects.

Full compatibility with all macOS versions is provided right out of the box.

There's no need for any modifications in your code to accommodate Apple users or developers.

We prioritize macOS support because many .NET developers, including our team members, prefer using _Visual Studio for Mac_ and _JetBrains Rider_ to develop .NET applications on macOS.

## macOS Configuration & Setup

IronBarCode NuGet packages are available for Mac deployments as detailed in our [IronBarCode NuGet installation guide](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/barcode/docs/).
