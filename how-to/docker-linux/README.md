## Benefits of Using Docker

Docker facilitates the process for developers to efficiently bundle, deploy, and operate applications as streamlined, movable, self-contained units, capable of being executed across varied environments seamlessly.

## Getting Started with IronBarCode and Linux

For those who are unfamiliar with using Docker alongside .NET, we suggest reviewing a thorough guide on configuring Docker for debugging and employing it within Visual Studio projects, available at [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/containers/edit-and-refresh?view=vs-2019).

Additionally, to ensure optimum compatibility and setup for IronBarCode on Linux, we strongly encourage you to explore our detailed [IronBarCode Linux Setup and Compatibility Guide](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/barcode/how-to/linux/).

### Suggested Linux Docker Distributions for IronBarCode

For seamless integration of IronBarCode, we recommend deploying on the latest 64-bit versions of the following Linux distributions:

- Ubuntu 22
- Ubuntu 20
- Ubuntu 18
- Debian 11
- Debian 10 _\[Currently the default Linux distribution on Microsoft Azure\]_
- CentOS 7

For Docker environments, it is advisable to utilize [Microsoft's Official Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-runtime/). While IronBarCode does support other Linux distributions, these might necessitate a manual setup using `apt-get`. For detailed instructions on manual configurations, refer to our [Linux Manual Setup](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/barcode/how-to/linux/) guide.

This document also provides Docker files tailored for Ubuntu and Debian to facilitate IronBarCode deployment.

## Essential Instructions for Installing IronBarCode on Linux Using Docker

### Recommended NuGet Package

For seamless integration across Windows, macOS, and Linux, we suggest implementing the [IronBarCode NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BarCode/), which is specifically designed for development in diverse environments.

```shell
Install-Package BarCode
```

### Utilizing the NuGet Package

For optimal development across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments, we suggest utilizing the [IronBarCode NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BarCode/).

```shell
Install-Package BarCode
```

This revised section includes the steps for setting up the runtime and development environments, detailing the installation and update processes, package restoration, project building, and the final preparation for deployment, all tailored specifically for Debian 11 with .NET 6.0 in a Docker container configuration.

### Debian 11 Featuring .NET 5

```console
# Starting with the runtime environment setup for Debian 11 using ASP.NET Core Runtime
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0-bullseye-slim AS base
WORKDIR /app
# Running package updates
RUN apt update

# Preparing the development environment with the .NET SDK on Debian 11
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0-bullseye-slim AS build
WORKDIR /src
# Restoring NuGet packages referenced in the project
COPY ["Example/Example.csproj", "Example/"]
RUN dotnet restore "Example/Example.csproj"
# Building the project from the source
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/Example"
RUN dotnet build "Example.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build
# Publishing the project to output directory
FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "Example.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish
# Final stage: Setting up the runtime environment with the published app
FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Example.dll"]
```

Here's the paraphrased section of the article:

```console
# initial runtime environment (Debian 11 with ASP.NET Core Runtime)

RUN apt update

# set up the development environment (Debian 11 with .NET SDK)
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0-bullseye-slim AS build
WORKDIR /src
# initiate the restoration of NuGet packages
COPY ["Example/Example.csproj", "Example/"]
RUN dotnet restore "Example/Example.csproj"
# initiate the build process 
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/Example"
RUN dotnet build "Example.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build
# start the publishing of the project
FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "Example.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish
# finalize the setup to run the application
FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Example.dll"]
```

### Debian 11 with Long-Term Support for .NET 3.1
