# Enhanced Support for macOS in IronBarcode with .NET Core

***Based on <https://ironsoftware.com/get-started/macos/>***


IronBarcode offers seamless support for macOS across both .NET Standard and .NET Core, catering to Intel and Apple silicon architectures effortlessly—no modifications are necessary for Apple users or developers.

Our commitment to macOS support is strong, partly because many .NET developers, including our own team members, prefer using _Visual Studio for Mac_ and _JetBrains Rider_ for macOS development.
